        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>
          This Moderation Policy governs your use of the Chat feature (referred
          to as "Features") on our various social media applications
          (collectively referred to as "Applications"), operated by Onlinefriend
          (hereinafter referred to as "Onlinefriend").
        </p>
        <p>
          This Moderation Policy applies to all digital interactions, whether
          paid or unpaid, occurring on the Applications. Your use of the

        <h2>No Active Moderation</h2>
        <p>
          Interactions that occur through the Features are not actively
          monitored, as they are private in nature. You acknowledge the
          unmoderated nature of these discussions and the inherent risks
          associated with engaging with strangers. However, in the interest of
          safety, we may periodically employ automated or AI-based tools to
          monitor interactions. Any interaction found to be in violation of our
          Policies will be terminated without compensation or refund.
