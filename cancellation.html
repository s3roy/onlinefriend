          <p>
            Once an order is placed and completed, refunds will not be

            they must contact OnlineFriend's customer care team within
            <strong>1 hour of payment</strong>. Refund requests made after this
            period will be considered at OnlineFriend's sole discretion.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Refunds for Technical Issues:</strong>
          <p>
            Refunds will not be issued for technical delays or glitches
            encountered on the OnlineFriend platform during order processing.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsibility for Accurate Information:</strong>
          <p>
            Refunds will not be granted if incorrect or inaccurate information
            is provided by the User. It is the User's responsibility to ensure
            all submitted details are accurate. However, corrections can be
            requested by contacting customer care within
            <strong>1 hour of order execution</strong>.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Subscription Service Delays:</strong>
          <p>
            In case of delays in activating subscription services, refunds may
            be offered on a <strong>pro-rata basis</strong> depending on the
            delay.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Product Variations and Display:</strong>
          <p>
            Product images on OnlineFriend are for reference purposes only.
            While every effort is made to deliver products as shown, refunds
            will not be granted for variations between the displayed images and
            actual products. Users should make purchases at their discretion.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Charges Deducted for Refunds:</strong>
          <p>
            Refunds, if approved, will be issued after deducting applicable
            charges, including transaction fees (bank or payment gateway fees),
            shipping costs, courier fees, customs duties, and any other related
            expenses.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Handling Payment Errors or Multiple Payments:</strong>
          <p>
            In the event of server issues with OnlineFriend or the payment
            gateway (e.g., session timeouts, slowdowns), Users should confirm
            whether their bank account has been debited before attempting
            another payment:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              If the account has been debited, Users should avoid initiating
              another payment and contact customer care for confirmation.
            </li>
            <li>
              If the account has not been debited, the User may proceed with a
              new transaction.
            </li>
            <li>
              For multiple payments made for the same order, a
              <strong>full refund</strong> of any extra payments will be
              processed without deducting transaction fees.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Order Cancellations by OnlineFriend:</strong>
          <p>
            OnlineFriend reserves the right to cancel any order for reasons such
            as service unavailability, pricing errors, or unforeseen issues. If
            an order is canceled after payment, the
            <strong>full amount paid</strong> will be refunded to the User.
          </p>
